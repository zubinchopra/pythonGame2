"""Flask_SOLUZION_Client_Server.py

Based on
Text_SOLUZION_Client.py
 This file implements a simple "SOLUZION" client and server that
 permits a user ("problem solver") to explore a search tree
 for a suitably-formulated problem.  The user only has to
 input single-character commands to control the search.
 Output is both textual and graphical,
 consisting of some limited content sent to a browser
 via HTTP ("Ajax" but using JSON or other data rather than XML).

 The program is started by typing
 $ ../Flask-SOLZ-Client-and-Server.py Missionaries
(You can replace "Missionaries" with the name of your problem template.)

 The client is a browser window or tab, going to the URL:
 http://localhost:5000

 These things can be changed if needed by editing the code.
